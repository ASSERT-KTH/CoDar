Annotation repetitions should not be wrapped
Why is this an issue? Before Java 8, a container annotation was required as wrapper to use multiple instances of the same annotation. As of Java 8, this is no longer necessary. Instead, these annotations should be used directly without a wrapper, resulting in cleaner and more readable code. This rule is automatically disabled when the projectâ€™s sonar.java.source is lower than 8 as repeating annotations were introduced in Java 8. Code examples 
### Noncompliant
@SomeAnnotations({  // Noncompliant, wrapper annotations are not necessary in Java 8+
  @SomeAnnotation(..a..),
  @SomeAnnotation(..b..),
  @SomeAnnotation(..c..),
})
public class SomeClass {
  ...
}
### Compliant
@SomeAnnotation(..a..)
@SomeAnnotation(..b..)
@SomeAnnotation(..c..)
public class SomeClass {
