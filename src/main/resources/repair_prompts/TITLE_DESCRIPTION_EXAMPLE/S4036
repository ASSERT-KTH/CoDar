Searching OS commands in PATH is security-sensitive
When executing an OS command and unless you specify the full path to the executable, then the locations in your applicationâ€™s PATH environment variable will be searched for the executable. That search could leave an opening for an attacker if one of the elements in PATH is a directory under his control. Ask Yourself Whether The directories in the PATH environment variable may be defined by not trusted entities. There is a risk if you answered yes to this question. Recommended Secure Coding Practices Fully qualified/absolute path should be used to specify the OS command to execute.
