Deprecated annotations should include explanations
Why is this an issue? Since Java 9, @Deprecated has two additional arguments to the annotation: since allows you to describe when the deprecation took place forRemoval, indicates whether the deprecated element will be removed at some future date In order to ease the maintainers work, it is recommended to always add one or both of these arguments. This rule reports an issue when @Deprecated is used without any argument.
