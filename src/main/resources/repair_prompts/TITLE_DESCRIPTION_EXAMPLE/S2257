Using non-standard cryptographic algorithms is security-sensitive
The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected. Standard algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, â€¦ should be used instead. This rule tracks creation of java.security.MessageDigest subclasses. Recommended Secure Coding Practices Use a standard algorithm instead of creating a custom one. 
### Noncompliant
public class MyCryptographicAlgorithm extends MessageDigest {
  ...
}
### Compliant
MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
### Noncompliant
