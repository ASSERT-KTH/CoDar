Hard-coded secrets are security-sensitive
Because it is easy to extract strings from an application source code or binary, secrets should not be hard-coded. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed or that are open-source. In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-25510 CVE-2021-42635 Secrets should be stored outside of the source code in a configuration file or a management service for secrets. This rule detects variables/fields having a name matching a list of words (secret, token, credential, auth, api[_.-]?key) being assigned a pseudorandom hard-coded value. The pseudorandomness of the hard-coded value is based on its entropy and the probability to be human-readable. The randomness sensibility can be adjusted if needed. Lower values will detect less random values, raising potentially more false positives. Ask Yourself Whether The secret allows access to a sensitive component like a database, a file storage, an API, or a service. The secret is used in a production environment. Application re-distribution is required before updating the secret. There would be a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions. Recommended Secure Coding Practices Store the secret in a configuration file that is not pushed to the code repository. Use your cloud providerâ€™s service for managing secrets. If a secret has been disclosed through the source code: revoke it and create a new one.
