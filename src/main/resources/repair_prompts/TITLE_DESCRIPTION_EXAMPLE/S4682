"@CheckForNull" or "@Nullable" should not be used on primitive types
Why is this an issue? By definition, primitive types are not Objects and so they canâ€™t be null. Adding @CheckForNull or @Nullable on primitive types adds confusion and is useless. This rule raises an issue when @CheckForNull or @Nullable is set on a method returning a primitive type: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char.
