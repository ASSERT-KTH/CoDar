Non-serializable objects should not be stored in "javax.servlet.http.HttpSession" instances
Why is this an issue? HttpSession s are managed by web servers and can be serialized and stored on disk as the server manages its memory use in a process called "passivation" (and later restored during "activation"). Even though HttpSession does not extend Serializable, you must nonetheless assume that it will be serialized. If non-serializable objects are stored in the session, serialization might fail. 
### Noncompliant
public class Address {
  //...
}

HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("address", new Address());  // Noncompliant; Address isn't serializable
### Compliant
public class Address implements Serializable {
  //...
}

HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("address", new Address());
