"Lock" objects should not be "synchronized"
java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock offers far more powerful and flexible locking operations than are available with synchronized blocks. So synchronizing on a Lock throws away the power of the object, and is just silly. Instead, such objects should be locked and unlocked using tryLock() and unlock().
