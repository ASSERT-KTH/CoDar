"ThreadLocal.withInitial" should be preferred
Why is this an issue? Java 8 introduced ThreadLocal.withInitial which is a simpler alternative to creating an anonymous inner class to initialise a ThreadLocal instance. This rule raises an issue when a ThreadLocal anonymous inner class can be replaced by a call to ThreadLocal.withInitial. 
### Noncompliant
ThreadLocal<List<String>> myThreadLocal =
    new ThreadLocal<List<String>>() { // Noncompliant
        @Override
        protected List<String> initialValue() {
            return new ArrayList<String>();
        }
    };
### Compliant
ThreadLocal<List<String>> myThreadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(ArrayList::new);
### Noncompliant
