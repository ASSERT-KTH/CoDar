Locks should be released on all paths
Why is this an issue? If a lock is acquired and released within a method, then it must be released along all execution paths of that method. Failing to do so will expose the conditional locking logic to the methodâ€™s callers and hence be deadlock-prone. 
### Noncompliant
public class MyClass {
  public void doSomething() {
    Lock lock = new Lock();
    lock.lock(); // Noncompliant
    if (isInitialized()) {
      // ...
      lock.unlock();
    }
  }
}
### Compliant
public class MyClass {
  public void doSomething() {
    Lock lock = new Lock();
    if (isInitialized()) {
      lock.lock();
      // ...
      lock.unlock();
    }
  }
}
