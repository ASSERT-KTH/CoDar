Delivering code in production with debug features activated is security-sensitive
Development tools and frameworks usually have options to make debugging easier for developers. Although these features are useful during development, they should never be enabled for applications deployed in production. Debug instructions or error messages can leak detailed information about the system, like the applicationâ€™s path or file names. Ask Yourself Whether The code or configuration enabling the application debug features is deployed on production servers or distributed to end users. The application runs by default with debug features activated. There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions. Recommended Secure Coding Practices Do not enable debugging features on production servers or applications distributed to end users.
