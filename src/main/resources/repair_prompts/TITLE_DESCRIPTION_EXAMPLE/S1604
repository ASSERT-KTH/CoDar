Anonymous inner classes containing only one method should become lambdas
Why is this an issue? Before Java 8, the only way to partially support closures in Java was by using anonymous inner classes. Java 8 introduced lambdas, which are significantly more readable and should be used instead. This rule is automatically disabled when the projectâ€™s sonar.java.source is lower than 8, as lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8. Code examples 
### Noncompliant
myCollection.stream().map(new Function<String,String>() { // Noncompliant, use a lambda expression instead
  @Override
  public String apply(String input) {
    return new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();
  }
})
  ...
### Compliant
myCollection.stream()
  .map(input -> new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString()) 
    ...
### Noncompliant
