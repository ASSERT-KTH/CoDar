"if ... else if" constructs should end with "else" clauses
Why is this an issue? This rule applies whenever an if statement is followed by one or more else if statements; the final else if should be followed by an else statement. The requirement for a final else statement is defensive programming. The else statement should either take appropriate action or contain a suitable comment as to why no action is taken. This is consistent with the requirement to have a final default clause in a switch statement.
