The diamond operator ("<>") should be used
Why is this an issue? Java 7 introduced the diamond operator (<>) to reduce the verbosity of generics code. For instance, instead of having to declare a List's type in both its declaration and its constructor, you can now simplify the constructor declaration with <>, and the compiler will infer the type. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the projectâ€™s sonar.java.source is lower than 7.
