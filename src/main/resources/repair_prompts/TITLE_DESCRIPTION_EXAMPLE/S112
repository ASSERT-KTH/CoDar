Generic exceptions should never be thrown
Why is this an issue? Using such generic exceptions as Error, RuntimeException, Throwable, and Exception prevents calling methods from handling true, system-generated exceptions differently than application-generated errors. 
### Noncompliant
public void foo(String bar) throws Throwable {  // Noncompliant
  throw new RuntimeException("My Message");     // Noncompliant
}
### Compliant
public void foo(String bar) {
  throw new MyOwnRuntimeException("My Message");
}
### Noncompliant
{{BUGGY}}
