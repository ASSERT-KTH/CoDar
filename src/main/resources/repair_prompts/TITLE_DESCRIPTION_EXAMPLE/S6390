Thread suspensions should not be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks
Why is this an issue?

Most modern applications use threads to handle incoming requests or other long-running tasks concurrently. In some cases, the number of concurrent threads is limited to avoid system resource exhaustion due to too numerous actions being run.

When an application uses user-controlled data as a parameter of a thread suspension operation, a Denial of Service attack can be made possible.
What is the potential impact?

An attacker with the capability to insert an arbitrary duration into a thread suspension operation could suspend the corresponding thread for a long time. Depending on the application’s architecture and the thread handling logic, this can lead to a complete Denial of Service of the application.

Indeed, if the number of threads, either created by the application or allocated by a web server, is limited, the attacker will be able to suspend all of them at the same time. Without any remaining thread to handle actions, the application might badly answer, be slowed down, or become completely irresponsive.

Code examples

This code is vulnerable to a Denial of Service because it sets a thread’s suspension time from user input without prior validation or sanitation.
### Noncompliant
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
        Long time = Long.parseLong(req.getParameter("time"));
        try {
            Thread.sleep(time); // Noncompliant
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            resp.sendError(500);
        }
    }
### Compliant
protected void compliant(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
        Long time = Long.parseLong(req.getParameter("time"));
        try {
            Thread.sleep(Math.min(time, 1000));
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            resp.sendError(500);
        }
    }
