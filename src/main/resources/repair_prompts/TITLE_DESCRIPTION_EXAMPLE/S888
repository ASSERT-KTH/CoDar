Equality operators should not be used in "for" loop termination conditions
Why is this an issue? Testing for loop termination using an equality operator (== and !=) is dangerous, because it could set up an infinite loop. Using a broader relational operator instead casts a wider net, and makes it harder (but not impossible) to accidentally write an infinite loop.
