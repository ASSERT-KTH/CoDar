Deprecated elements should have both the annotation and the Javadoc tag
Why is this an issue? Deprecation should be marked with both the @Deprecated annotation and @deprecated Javadoc tag. The annotation enables tools such as IDEs to warn about referencing deprecated elements, and the tag can be used to explain when it was deprecated, why, and how references should be refactored. 
### Noncompliant
class MyClass {

  @Deprecated
  public void foo1() {    // Noncompliant: Add the missing @deprecated Javadoc tag.
  }

  /**
    * @deprecated
    */
  public void foo2() {    // Noncompliant: Add the missing @Deprecated annotation.
  }

}
### Compliant
class MyClass {

  /**
    * @deprecated (when, why, refactoring advice...)
    */
  @Deprecated
  public void foo1() {
  }
