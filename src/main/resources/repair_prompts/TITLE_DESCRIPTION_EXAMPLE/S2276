"wait(...)" should be used instead of "Thread.sleep(...)" when a lock is held
If Thread.sleep(...) is called when the current thread holds a lock, it could lead to performance and scalability issues, or even worse to deadlocks because the execution of the thread holding the lock is frozen. Itâ€™s better to call wait(...) on the monitor object to temporarily release the lock and allow other threads to run.
