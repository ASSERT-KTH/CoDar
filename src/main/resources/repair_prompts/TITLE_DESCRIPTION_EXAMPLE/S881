Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators should not be used in a method call or mixed with other operators in an expression
Why is this an issue? The use of increment and decrement operators in method calls or in combination with other arithmetic operators is not recommended, because: It can significantly impair the readability of the code. It introduces additional side effects into a statement, with the potential for undefined behavior. It is safer to use these operators in isolation from any other arithmetic operators.
