"@Controller" classes that use "@SessionAttributes" must call "setComplete" on their "SessionStatus" objects
Why is this an issue? A Spring @Controller that uses @SessionAttributes is designed to handle a stateful / multi-post form. Such @Controllers use the specified @SessionAttributes to store data on the server between requests. That data should be cleaned up when the session is over, but unless setComplete() is called on the SessionStatus object from a @RequestMapping method, neither Spring nor the JVM will know it’s time to do that. Note that the SessionStatus object must be passed to that method as a parameter. 
### Noncompliant
@Controller
@SessionAttributes("hello")  // Noncompliant; this doesn't get cleaned up
public class HelloWorld {

  @RequestMapping("/greet", method = GET)
  public String greet(String greetee) {

    return "Hello " + greetee;
  }
}
### Compliant
@Controller
@SessionAttributes("hello")
public class HelloWorld {

  @RequestMapping("/greet", method = GET)
  public String greet(String greetee) {

    return "Hello " + greetee;
  }

  @RequestMapping("/goodbye", method = POST)
  public String goodbye(SessionStatus status) {
    //...
    status.setComplete();
  }

}
