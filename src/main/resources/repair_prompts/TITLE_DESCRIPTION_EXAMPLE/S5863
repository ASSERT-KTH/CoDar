Assertions should not compare an object to itself
Why is this an issue? Assertions comparing an object to itself are more likely to be bugs due to developerâ€™s carelessness. This rule raises an issue when the actual expression matches the expected expression. 
### Noncompliant
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(actual); // Noncompliant
### Compliant
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);
### Noncompliant
{{BUGGY}}
### Compliant
