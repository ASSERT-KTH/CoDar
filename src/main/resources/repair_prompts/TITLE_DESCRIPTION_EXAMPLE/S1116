Empty statements should be removed
Why is this an issue? Empty statements, i.e. ;, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because: It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten. There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. ;;. 
### Noncompliant
void doSomething() {
  ;                                                       // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");;                     // Noncompliant - double ;
  ...
}
### Compliant
void doSomething() {}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  ...
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) ; // compliant if unique statement of a loop
  ...
}
