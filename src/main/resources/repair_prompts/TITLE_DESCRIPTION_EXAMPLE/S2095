Resources should be closed
Why is this an issue?

Connections, streams, files, and other classes that implement the Closeable interface or its super-interface, AutoCloseable, needs to be closed after use. Further, that close call must be made in a finally block otherwise an exception could keep the call from being made. Preferably, when class implements AutoCloseable, resource should be created using "try-with-resources" pattern and will be closed automatically.

Failure to properly close resources will result in a resource leak which could bring first the application and then perhaps the box the application is on to their knees.
