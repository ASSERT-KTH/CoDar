Extensions and implementations should not be redundant
Why is this an issue? All classes extend Object implicitly. Doing so explicitly is redundant. Further, declaring the implementation of an interface and one if its parents is also redundant. If you implement the interface, you also implicitly implement its parents and there’s no need to do so explicitly. 
### Noncompliant
public interface MyFace {
  // ...
}

public interface MyOtherFace extends MyFace {
  // ...
}

public class Foo
    extends Object // Noncompliant
    implements MyFace, MyOtherFace {  // Noncompliant
  //...
}
### Compliant
public interface MyFace {
  // ...
}

public interface MyOtherFace extends MyFace {
  // ...
}

public class Foo implements MyOtherFace {
  //...
}
