AssertJ methods setting the assertion context should come before an assertion
Why is this an issue? Describing, setting error message or adding a comparator in AssertJ must be done before calling the assertion, otherwise, settings will not be taken into account. This rule raises an issue when one of the method (with all similar methods): as describedAs withFailMessage overridingErrorMessage usingComparator usingElementComparator extracting filteredOn is called without calling an AssertJ assertion afterward. 
### Noncompliant
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).as("Description"); // Noncompliant
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).withFailMessage("Fail message"); // Noncompliant
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).usingComparator(new CustomComparator()); // Noncompliant
### Compliant
assertThat(actual).as("Description").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).withFailMessage("Fail message").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).usingComparator(new CustomComparator()).isEqualTo(expected);
