Exceptions in "throws" clauses should not be superfluous
Why is this an issue? Superfluous exceptions within throws clauses have negative effects on the readability and maintainability of the code. An exception in a throws clause is superfluous if it is: listed multiple times a subclass of another listed exception not actually thrown by any execution path of the method 
### Noncompliant
void foo() throws MyException, MyException {}  // Noncompliant; should be listed once
void bar() throws Throwable, Exception {}  // Noncompliant; Exception is a subclass of Throwable
void boo() throws IOException { // Noncompliant; IOException cannot be thrown
  System.out.println("Hi!");
}
### Compliant
void foo() throws MyException {}
void bar() throws Throwable {}
void boo() {
  System.out.println("Hi!");
}
### Noncompliant
{{BUGGY}}
