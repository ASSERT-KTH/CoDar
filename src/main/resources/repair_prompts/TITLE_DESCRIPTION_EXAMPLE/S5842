Repeated patterns in regular expressions should not match the empty string
Why is this an issue? A regex should never include a repetitive pattern whose body would match the empty string. This is usually a sign that a part of the regex is redundant or does not do what the author intended. 
### Noncompliant
"(?:)*"      // same as the empty regex, the '*' accomplishes nothing
"(?:|x)*"    // same as the empty regex, the alternative has no effect
"(?:x|)*"    // same as 'x*', the empty alternative has no effect
"(?:x*|y*)*" // same as 'x*', the first alternative would always match, y* is never tried
"(?:x?)*"    // same as 'x*'
"(?:x?)+"    // same as 'x*'
### Compliant
"x*"
### Noncompliant
