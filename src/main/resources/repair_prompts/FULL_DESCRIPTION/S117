Local variable and method parameter names should comply with a naming convention
Why is this an issue? Shared naming conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. This rule raises an issue when a local variable or function parameter name does not match the provided regular expression. 
### Noncompliant
With the default regular expression ^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$: public void doSomething(int my_param) {
  int LOCAL;
  ...
}
 
### Compliant
public void doSomething(int myParam) {
  int local;
  ...
}
 Exceptions Loop counters are ignored by this rule. for (int i_1 = 0; i_1 < limit; i_1++) {  
  // ...
}
 as well as one-character catch variables: try {
//...
} catch (Exception e) { 
}
