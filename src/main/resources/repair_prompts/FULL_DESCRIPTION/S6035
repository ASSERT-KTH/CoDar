Single-character alternations in regular expressions should be replaced with character classes
Why is this an issue? When an alternation contains multiple alternatives that consist of a single character, it can be rewritten as a character class. This should be preferred because it is more efficient and can even help prevent stack overflows when used inside a repetition (see rule S5998).
