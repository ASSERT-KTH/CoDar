Constructors of an "abstract" class should not be declared "public"
Why is this an issue? Abstract classes should not have public constructors. Constructors of abstract classes can only be called in constructors of their subclasses. So there is no point in making them public. The protected modifier should be enough. 
### Noncompliant
public abstract class AbstractClass1 {
    public AbstractClass1 () { // Noncompliant, has public modifier
        // do something here
    }
}
 
### Compliant
public abstract class AbstractClass2 {
    protected AbstractClass2 () {
        // do something here
    }
}
### Noncompliant
