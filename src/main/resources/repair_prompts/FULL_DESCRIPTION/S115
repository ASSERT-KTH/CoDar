Constant names should comply with a naming convention
Why is this an issue? Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all constant names match a provided regular expression. 
### Noncompliant
With the default regular expression ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*(_[A-Z0-9]+)*$: public class MyClass {
  public static final int first = 1;
}

public enum MyEnum {
  first;
}
 
### Compliant
public class MyClass {
  public static final int FIRST = 1;
}

public enum MyEnum {
  FIRST;
}
### Noncompliant
{{BUGGY}}
