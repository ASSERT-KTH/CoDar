"readObject" should not be "synchronized"
Why is this an issue? The readObject method is implemented when a Serializable object requires special handling to be reconstructed from a file. The object created by readObject is accessed only by the thread that called the method, thus using the synchronized keyword in this context is unnecessary and causes confusion.
