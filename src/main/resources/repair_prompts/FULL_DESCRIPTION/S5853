Consecutive AssertJ "assertThat" statements should be chained
Why is this an issue? AssertJ assertions methods targeting the same object can be chained instead of using multiple assertThat. It avoids duplication and increases the clarity of the code. This rule raises an issue when multiples assertThat target the same tested value. 
### Noncompliant
assertThat(someList).hasSize(3);
assertThat(someList).contains("something");
 
### Compliant
assertThat(someList)
  .hasSize(3)
  .contains("something");
