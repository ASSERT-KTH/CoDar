"readResolve" methods should be inheritable
Why is this an issue? Developers may want to add some logic to handle deserialized objects before they are returned to the caller. This can be achieved by implementing the readResolve method. Non-final classes implementing readResolve should not set its visibility to private as this would make it unavailable to child classes. Instead, mark readResolve as protected, allowing it to be inherited. Code examples 
### Noncompliant
public class Fruit implements Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1;

  private Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException // Noncompliant, `readResolve` should not be private
  {...}

  //...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit implements Serializable { // This class has no access to the parent's "readResolve" method
  //...
}
 
### Compliant
public class Fruit implements Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1;

  protected Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException // Compliant, `readResolve` is protected
  {...}

  //...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit implements Serializable { // This class has access to the parent's "readResolve"
  //...
}
