Abstract classes without fields should be converted to interfaces
With Java 8’s "default method" feature, any abstract class without direct or inherited field should be converted into an interface. However, this change may not be appropriate in libraries or other applications where the class is intended to be used as an API. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the project’s sonar.java.source is lower than 8.
