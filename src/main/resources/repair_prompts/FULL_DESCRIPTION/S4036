Searching OS commands in PATH is security-sensitive
When executing an OS command and unless you specify the full path to the executable, then the locations in your applicationâ€™s PATH environment variable will be searched for the executable. That search could leave an opening for an attacker if one of the elements in PATH is a directory under his control. Ask Yourself Whether The directories in the PATH environment variable may be defined by not trusted entities. There is a risk if you answered yes to this question. Recommended Secure Coding Practices Fully qualified/absolute path should be used to specify the OS command to execute. 
### Noncompliant
The full path of the command is not specified and thus the executable will be searched in all directories listed in the PATH environment variable: Runtime.getRuntime().exec("make");  // Sensitive
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"make"});  // Sensitive

ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder("make");  // Sensitive
builder.command("make");  // Sensitive
 
### Compliant
The command is defined by its full path: Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/usr/bin/make");  
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"~/bin/make"});  

ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder("./bin/make");  
builder.command("../bin/make");  
builder.command(Arrays.asList("..\bin\make", "-j8")); 

builder = new ProcessBuilder(Arrays.asList(".\make"));  
builder.command(Arrays.asList("C:\bin\make", "-j8"));  
builder.command(Arrays.asList("\\SERVER\bin\make"));
