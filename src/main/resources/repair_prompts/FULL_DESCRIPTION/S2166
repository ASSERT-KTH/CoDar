Classes named like "Exception" should extend "Exception" or a subclass
Why is this an issue? Clear, communicative naming is important in code. It helps maintainers and API users understand the intentions for and uses of a unit of code. Using "exception" in the name of a class that does not extend Exception or one of its subclasses is a clear violation of the expectation that a class' name will indicate what it is and/or does. 
### Noncompliant
public class FruitException {  // Noncompliant; this has nothing to do with Exception

public class CarException {  // Noncompliant; the extends clause was forgotten?
  public CarException(String message, Throwable cause) {
  // ...

public class CarException extends Exception {
