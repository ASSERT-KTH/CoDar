Regular expressions should not contain multiple spaces
Why is this an issue? Multiple spaces in a regular expression can make it hard to tell how many spaces should be matched. Itâ€™s more readable to use only one space and then indicate with a quantifier how many spaces are expected. 
### Noncompliant
Pattern.compile("hello   world");
 
### Compliant
Pattern.compile("hello {3}world");
 Exceptions In free-spacing mode (Pattern.COMMENTS flag, or with embedded flag expression (?x)), whitespaces are ignored. In this case no issue should be triggered, because the whitespaces may be intended to improve readability.
