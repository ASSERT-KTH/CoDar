Server-side requests should not be vulnerable to forging attacks
Why is this an issue? Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when attackers can coerce a server to perform arbitrary requests on their behalf. An SSRF vulnerability can either be basic or blind, depending on whether the server’s fetched data is directly returned in the web application’s response. The absence of the corresponding response for the coerced request on the application is not a barrier to exploitation and thus must be treated in the same way as basic SSRF. What is the potential impact? SSRF usually results in unauthorized actions or data disclosure in the vulnerable application or on a different system it can reach. Conditional to what is reachable, remote command execution can be achieved, although it often requires chaining with further exploitations. Information disclosure is SSRF’s core outcome. Depending on the extracted data, an attacker can perform a variety of different actions that can range from low to critical severity. Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability. Local file read to host takeover An attacker manipulates an application into performing a local request for a sensitive file, such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa, by using the File URI scheme file://. Once in possession of the SSH keys, the attacker establishes a remote connection to the system hosting the web application. Internal Network Reconnaissance An attacker enumerates internal accessible ports from the affected server or others to which the server can communicate by iterating over the port field in the URL http://127.0.0.1:{port}. Taking advantage of other supported URL schemas (dependent on the affected system), for example, gopher://127.0.0.1:3306, an attacker would be able to connect to a database service and perform queries on it. How to fix it in Java SE Code examples The following code is vulnerable to SSRF as it performs an HTTP request to a URL defined by untrusted data. 
### Noncompliant
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
    String location = req.getParameter("url");

    URL url = new URL(location);

    HttpURLConnection  conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
}
 
### Compliant
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws IOException {
    String location = req.getParameter("url");

    List<String> allowedHosts = new ArrayList<String>();
    allowedHosts.add("https://trusted1.example.com/");
    allowedHosts.add("https://trusted2.example.com/");

    URL url = new URL(location);

    if (allowedHosts.contains(location))
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
}
 How does this work? The application should avoid opening URLs that are constructed with untrusted data. When such a feature is strictly necessary, SSRF can be mitigated by applying an allow-list of trustable schemes and domains. The compliant code example uses such an approach. Pitfalls The trap of 'StartsWith' and equivalents When validating untrusted URLs by checking if they start with a trusted scheme and authority pair scheme://authority, ensure that the validation string contains a path separator / as the last character. If the validation string does not contain a terminating path separator, the SSRF vulnerability remains; only the exploitation technique changes. Thus, a validation like startsWith("https://example.com") or an equivalent with the regex ^https://example\.com.* can be exploited with the following URL https://example.commit.malicious.io.
