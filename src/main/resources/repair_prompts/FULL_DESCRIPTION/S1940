Boolean checks should not be inverted
Why is this an issue? It is needlessly complex to invert the result of a boolean comparison. The opposite comparison should be made instead. 
### Noncompliant
if ( !(a == 2)) { ...}  // Noncompliant
boolean b = !(i < 10);  // Noncompliant
 
### Compliant
if (a != 2) { ...}
boolean b = (i >= 10);
### Noncompliant
