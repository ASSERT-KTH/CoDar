"String.valueOf()" should not be appended to a "String"
Why is this an issue? Appending String.valueOf() to a String decreases the code readability. The argument passed to String.valueOf() should be directly appended instead. 
### Noncompliant
String message = "Output is " + String.valueOf(12);

String message = "Output is " + 12;
