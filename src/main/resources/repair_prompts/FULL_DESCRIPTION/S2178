Short-circuit logic should be used in boolean contexts
Why is this an issue? The use of non-short-circuit logic in a boolean context is likely a mistake - one that could cause serious program errors as conditions are evaluated under the wrong circumstances. 
### Noncompliant
if(getTrue() | getFalse()) { ... } // Noncompliant; both sides evaluated
 
### Compliant
if(getTrue() || getFalse()) { ... } // true short-circuit logic
