"switch" statements should have at least 3 "case" clauses
Why is this an issue? switch statements are useful when there are many different cases depending on the value of the same expression. For just one or two cases however, the code will be more readable with if statements. 
### Noncompliant
switch (variable) {
  case 0:
    doSomething();
    break;
  default:
    doSomethingElse();
    break;
}
 
### Compliant
if (variable == 0) {
  doSomething();
} else {
  doSomethingElse();
}
