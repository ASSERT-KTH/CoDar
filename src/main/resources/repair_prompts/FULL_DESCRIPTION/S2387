Child class fields should not shadow parent class fields
Why is this an issue? Having a variable with the same name in two unrelated classes is fine, but do the same thing within a class hierarchy and youâ€™ll get confusion at best, chaos at worst. 
### Noncompliant
public class Fruit {
  protected Season ripe;
  protected Color flesh;

  // ...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit {
  private boolean ripe;  // Noncompliant
  private static Color FLESH; // Noncompliant
}
 
### Compliant
public class Fruit {
  protected Season ripe;
  protected Color flesh;

  // ...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit {
  private boolean ripened;
  private static Color FLESH_COLOR;

}
 Exceptions This rule ignores same-name fields that are static in both the parent and child classes. This rule ignores private parent class fields, but in all other such cases, the child class field should be renamed. public class Fruit {
  private Season ripe;
  // ...
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit {
  private Season ripe;  
  // ...
}
