"notifyAll()" should be preferred over "notify()"
Why is this an issue? notify and notifyAll both wake up sleeping threads waiting on the objectâ€™s monitor, but notify only wakes up one single thread, while notifyAll wakes them all up. Unless you do not care which specific thread is woken up, notifyAll should be used instead. 
### Noncompliant
class MyThread implements Runnable {
  Object lock = new Object();

  @Override
  public void run() {
    synchronized(lock) {
      // ...
      lock.notify();  // Noncompliant
    }
  }
}
 
### Compliant
class MyThread implements Runnable {
  Object lock = new Object();

  @Override
  public void run() {
    synchronized(lock) {
      // ...
      lock.notifyAll();
    }
  }
}
