Methods should not return constants
Why is this an issue? There’s no point in forcing the overhead of a method call for a method that always returns the same constant value. Even worse, the fact that a method call must be made will likely mislead developers who call the method thinking that something more is done. Declare a constant instead. This rule raises an issue if on methods that contain only one statement: the return of a constant value. 
### Noncompliant
int getBestNumber() {
  return 12;  // Noncompliant
}
 
### Compliant
static final int BEST_NUMBER = 12;
 Exceptions The following types of method are ignored: methods that override a method. methods that are not final (not having the final, private or static modifier and not in a record or a final class). methods with annotations, such as @Override or Spring’s @RequestMapping.
