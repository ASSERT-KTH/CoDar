Exception classes should have final fields
Why is this an issue? When a class has all final fields, the compiler ensures that the object’s state remains constant. It also enforces a clear design intent of immutability, making the class easier to reason about and use correctly. Exceptions are meant to represent the application’s state at the point at which an error occurred. Making all fields in an Exception class final ensures that these class fields do not change after initialization.
