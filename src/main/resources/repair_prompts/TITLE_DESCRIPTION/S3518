Zero should not be a possible denominator
Why is this an issue? If the denominator to a division or modulo operation is zero it would result in a fatal error. When working with double or float, no fatal error will be raised, but it will lead to unusual result and should be avoided anyway. This rule supports primitive int, long, double, float as well as BigDecimal and BigInteger.
