"null" should not be returned from a "Boolean" method
Why is this an issue? Callers of a Boolean method may be expecting to receive true or false in response. But Boolean objects can take null as a possible value. Boolean methods should not return null unless the code is annotated appropriately. With the proper annotation, the caller is aware that the returned value could be null.
