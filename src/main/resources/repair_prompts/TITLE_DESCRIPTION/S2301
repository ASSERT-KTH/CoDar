Public methods should not contain selector arguments
Why is this an issue? A selector argument is a boolean argument that’s used to determine which of two paths to take through a method. Specifying such a parameter may seem innocuous, particularly if it’s well named. Unfortunately, the maintainers of the code calling the method won’t see the parameter name, only its value. They’ll be forced either to guess at the meaning or to take extra time to look the method up. Instead, separate methods should be written. This rule finds methods with a boolean that’s used to determine which path to take through the method.
