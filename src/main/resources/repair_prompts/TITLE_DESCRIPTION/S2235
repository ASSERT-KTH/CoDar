"IllegalMonitorStateException" should not be caught
Why is this an issue? The IllegalMonitorStateException is an exception that occurs when a thread tries to perform an operation on an objectâ€™s monitor that it does not own. This exception is typically thrown when a method like wait(), notify(), or notifyAll() is called outside a synchronized block or method. IllegalMonitorStateException is specifically designed to be an unchecked exception to point out a programming mistake. This exception serves as a reminder for developers to rectify their code by correctly acquiring and releasing locks using synchronized blocks or methods. It also emphasizes the importance of calling monitor-related methods on the appropriate objects to ensure proper synchronization. Catching and handling this exception can mask underlying synchronization issues and lead to unpredictable behavior.
