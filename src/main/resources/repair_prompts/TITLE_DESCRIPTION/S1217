"Thread.run()" should not be called directly
This rule raises an issue when Thread.run() is called instead of Thread.start(). Why is this an issue? The likely intention of a user calling Thread.run() is to start the execution of code within a new thread. This, however, is not what happens when this method is called. The purpose of Thread.run() is to provide a method that users can overwrite to specify the code to be executed. The actual thread is then started by calling Thread.start(). When Thread.run() is called directly, it will be executed as a regular method within the current thread. How to fix it If you intend to execute the contents of the Thread.run() method within a new thread, call Thread.start() instead. If your intention is only to have a container for a method but execute this method within the current thread, do not use Thread but Runnable or another functional interface. Code examples
