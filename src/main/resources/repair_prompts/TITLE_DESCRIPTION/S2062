"readResolve" methods should be inheritable
Why is this an issue? Developers may want to add some logic to handle deserialized objects before they are returned to the caller. This can be achieved by implementing the readResolve method. Non-final classes implementing readResolve should not set its visibility to private as this would make it unavailable to child classes. Instead, mark readResolve as protected, allowing it to be inherited. Code examples
