Private mutable members should not be stored or returned directly
Why is this an issue? Mutable objects are those whose state can be changed. For instance, an array is mutable, but a String is not. Private mutable class members should never be returned to a caller or accepted and stored directly. Doing so leaves you vulnerable to unexpected changes in your class state. Instead use an unmodifiable Collection (via Collections.unmodifiableCollection, Collections.unmodifiableList, …) or make a copy of the mutable object, and store or return the copy instead. This rule checks that private arrays, collections and Dates are not stored or returned directly.
