Assertion methods should not be used within the try block of a try-catch catching an Error
Why is this an issue? Assertion methods are throwing a "java.lang.AssertionError". If this call is done within the try block of a try-catch cathing a similar error, you should make sure to test some properties of the exception. Otherwise, the assertion will never fail.
