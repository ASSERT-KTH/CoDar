Arrays should not be copied using loops
Why is this an issue? Using a loop to copy an array or a subset of an array is simply wasted code when there are built-in functions to do it for you. Instead, use Arrays.copyOf to copy an entire array into another array, use System.arraycopy to copy only a subset of an array into another array, and use Arrays.asList to feed the constructor of a new list with an array. Note that Arrays.asList simply puts a Collections wrapper around the original array, so further steps are required if a non-fixed-size List is desired.
