Recursion should not be infinite
Why is this an issue? Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where a method calls itself with smaller instances of the same input. This can happen when a method invokes itself or when a pair of methods invoke each other. It can be a useful tool, but unless the method includes a provision to break out of the recursion and return, the recursion will continue until the stack overflows and the program crashes.
