DateTimeFormatters should not use mismatched year and week numbers
Why is this an issue? When creating a DateTimeFormatter using the WeekFields.weekBasedYear() temporal field, the resulting year number may be off by 1 at the beginning of a new year (when the date to format is in a week that is shared by two consecutive years). Using this year number in combination with an incompatible week temporal field yields a result that may be confused with the first week of the previous year. Instead, when paired with a week temporal field, the week-based year should only be used with the week of week-based year temporal field WeekFields.weekOfWeekBasedYear(). Alternatively the temporal field ChronoField.ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR can be used together with a regular year (but not the week based year).
