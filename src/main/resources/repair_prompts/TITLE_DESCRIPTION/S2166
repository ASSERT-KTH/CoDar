Classes named like "Exception" should extend "Exception" or a subclass
Why is this an issue? Clear, communicative naming is important in code. It helps maintainers and API users understand the intentions for and uses of a unit of code. Using "exception" in the name of a class that does not extend Exception or one of its subclasses is a clear violation of the expectation that a class' name will indicate what it is and/or does.
