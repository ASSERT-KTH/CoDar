"switch" statements and expressions should not be nested
Nested switch structures are difficult to understand because you can easily confuse the cases of an inner switch as belonging to an outer statement or expression. Therefore nested switch statements and expressions should be avoided. Specifically, you should structure your code to avoid the need for nested switch statements or expressions, but if you cannot, then consider moving the inner switch to another method.
