"PreparedStatement" and "ResultSet" methods should be called with valid indices
Why is this an issue? PreparedStatement is an object that represents a precompiled SQL statement, that can be used to execute the statement multiple times efficiently. ResultSet is the Java representation of the result set of a database query obtained from a Statement object. A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves forward only. The parameters in PreparedStatement and ResultSet are indexed beginning at 1, not 0. When an invalid index is passed to the PreparedStatement or ResultSet methods, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. This can cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly, leading to a poor user experience. This rule raises an issue for the get methods in PreparedStatement and the set methods in ResultSet. How to fix it Ensure the index passed to the PreparedStatement and ResultSet methods is valid. Code examples
