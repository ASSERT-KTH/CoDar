"notifyAll()" should be preferred over "notify()"
Why is this an issue? notify and notifyAll both wake up sleeping threads waiting on the objectâ€™s monitor, but notify only wakes up one single thread, while notifyAll wakes them all up. Unless you do not care which specific thread is woken up, notifyAll should be used instead.
