Persistent entities should not be used as arguments of "@RequestMapping" methods
Why is this an issue? On one side, Spring MVC automatically bind request parameters to beans declared as arguments of methods annotated with @RequestMapping. Because of this automatic binding feature, it’s possible to feed some unexpected fields on the arguments of the @RequestMapping annotated methods. On the other end, persistent objects (@Entity or @Document) are linked to the underlying database and updated automatically by a persistence framework, such as Hibernate, JPA or Spring Data MongoDB. These two facts combined together can lead to malicious attack: if a persistent object is used as an argument of a method annotated with @RequestMapping, it’s possible from a specially crafted user input, to change the content of unexpected fields into the database. For this reason, using @Entity or @Document objects as arguments of methods annotated with @RequestMapping should be avoided. In addition to @RequestMapping, this rule also considers the annotations introduced in Spring Framework 4.3: @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PatchMapping.
