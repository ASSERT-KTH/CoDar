Enum values should be compared with "=="
Why is this an issue? Testing equality of an enum value with equals is perfectly valid because an enum is an Object and every Java developer knows "==" should not be used to compare the content of an Object. At the same time, using "==" on enums: provides the same expected comparison (content) as equals is more null-safe than equals() provides compile-time (static) checking rather than runtime checking For these reasons, use of "==" should be preferred to equals.
