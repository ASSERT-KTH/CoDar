"compareTo" results should not be checked for specific values
Why is this an issue? Assuming that a comparator or compareTo method always returns -1 or 1 if the first operand is less than or greater than the second is incorrect. The specifications for both methods, Comparator.compare and Comparable.compareTo, state that their return value is "a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object." Even if a specific comparator always returns -1, 0, or 1, this is only an implementation detail, not the API contract developers can rely on. How to fix it Replace == -1 with < 0 (the first operand is less than the second) == 1 with > 0 (the first operand is greater than the second) != -1 with >= 0 (the first operand is greater than or equal to the second) != 1 with <= 0 (the first operand is less than or equal to the second) Code examples
