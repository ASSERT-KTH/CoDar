Wildcard imports should not be used
Why is this an issue? Blindly importing all the classes in a package clutters the class namespace and could lead to conflicts between classes in different packages with the same name. On the other hand, specifically listing the necessary classes avoids that problem and makes clear which versions were wanted.
