Case insensitive Unicode regular expressions should enable the "UNICODE_CASE" flag
Why is this an issue? By default case insensitivity only affects letters in the ASCII range. This can be changed by either passing Pattern.UNICODE_CASE or Pattern.UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS as an argument to Pattern.compile or using (?u) or (?U) within the regex. If not done, regular expressions involving non-ASCII letters will still handle those letters as being case sensitive.
