An iteration on a Collection should be performed on the type handled by the Collection
Why is this an issue? This rule raises an issue when an iteration over the items of a Collection is performed on a super-type of the type handled by the Collection. Relying on Object or any classes between Object and the real class handled by the Collection is not recommended. While itâ€™s accepted by the language, this practice reduces readability of the code and forces to down-cast the item of the Collection to be able to call a method on it while simply using the correct type in the iteration makes things more clear and simple.
