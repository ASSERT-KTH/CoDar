Unicode-aware versions of character classes should be preferred
Why is this an issue? When using POSIX classes like \p{Alpha} without the UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS flag or when using hard-coded character classes like "[a-zA-Z]", letters outside of the ASCII range, such as umlauts, accented letters or letter from non-Latin languages, wonâ€™t be matched. This may cause code to incorrectly handle input containing such letters. To correctly handle non-ASCII input, it is recommended to use Unicode classes like \p{IsAlphabetic}. When using POSIX classes, Unicode support should be enabled by either passing Pattern.UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS as a flag to Pattern.compile or by using (?U) inside the regex.
