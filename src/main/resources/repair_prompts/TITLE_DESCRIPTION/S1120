Source code should be indented consistently
Proper indentation is a simple and effective way to improve the codeâ€™s readability. Consistent indentation among the developers within a team also reduces the differences that are committed to source control systems, making code reviews easier. This rule raises an issue when indentation does not match the configured value. Only the first line of a badly indented section is reported.
