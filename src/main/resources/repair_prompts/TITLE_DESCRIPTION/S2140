Methods of "Random" that return floating point values should not be used in random integer generation
There is no need to multiply the output of Random's nextDouble method to get a random integer. Use the nextInt method instead. This rule raises an issue when the return value of any of Random's methods that return a floating point value is converted to an integer.
