"=+" should not be used instead of "+="
The use of operators pairs ( =+, =- or =! ) where the reversed, single operator was meant (+=, -= or !=) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results. This rule raises an issue when =+, =-, or =! is used without any spacing between the two operators and when there is at least one whitespace character after.
