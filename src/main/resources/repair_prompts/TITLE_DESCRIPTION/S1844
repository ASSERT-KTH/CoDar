"Object.wait" should not be called on objects that implement "java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition"
Why is this an issue? The java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition interface provides an alternative to the Object monitor methods (wait, notify and notifyAll). Hence, the purpose of implementing said interface is to gain access to its more nuanced await methods. Consequently, calling the method Object.wait on a class implementing the Condition interface is contradictory and should be avoided. Use Condition.await instead. Code examples
