Variables should not be declared before they are relevant
Why is this an issue? For the sake of clarity, variables should be declared as close to where theyâ€™re used as possible. This is particularly true when considering methods that contain early returns and the potential to throw exceptions. In these cases, it is not only pointless, but also confusing to declare a variable that may never be used because conditions for an early return are met first.
