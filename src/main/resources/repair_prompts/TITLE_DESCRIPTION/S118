Abstract class names should comply with a naming convention
Why is this an issue? Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all abstract class names match a provided regular expression. If a non-abstract class match the regular expression, an issue is raised to suggest to either make it abstract or to rename it.
