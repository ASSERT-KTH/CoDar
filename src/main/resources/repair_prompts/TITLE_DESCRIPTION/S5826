Methods setUp() and tearDown() should be correctly annotated starting with JUnit4
Why is this an issue? The setUp() and tearDown() methods (initially introduced with JUnit3 to execute a block of code before and after each test) need to be correctly annotated with the equivalent annotation in order to preserve the same behavior when migrating from JUnit3 to JUnit4 or JUnit5. This rule consequently raise issues on setUp() and tearDown() methods which are not annotated in test classes.
