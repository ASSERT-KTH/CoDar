Local-Variable Type Inference should be used
Why is this an issue? In Java 10 Local-Variable Type Inference was introduced. It allows you to omit the expected type of a variable by declaring it with the var keyword. While it is not always possible or cleaner to use this new way of declaring a variable, when the type on the left is the same as the one on the right in an assignment, using the var will result in a more concise code. This rule reports an issue when the expected type of the variable is the same as the returned type of assigned expression and the type can be easily inferred by the reader, either when the type is already mentioned in the name or the initializer, or when the expression is self-explanatory.
