Public constants and fields initialized at declaration should be "static final" rather than merely "final"
Why is this an issue? Making a public constant just final as opposed to static final leads to duplicating its value for every instance of the class, uselessly increasing the amount of memory required to execute the application. Further, when a non-public, final field isnâ€™t also static, it implies that different instances can have different values. However, initializing a non-static final field in its declaration forces every instance to have the same value. So such fields should either be made static or initialized in the constructor.
