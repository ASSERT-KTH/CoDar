"Math.abs" and negation should not be used on numbers that could be "MIN_VALUE"
Why is this an issue? This rule involves the use of Math.abs and negation on numbers that could be MIN_VALUE. It is a problem because it can lead to incorrect results and unexpected behavior in the program. When Math.abs and negation are used on numbers that could be MIN_VALUE, the result can be incorrect due to integer overflow. Common methods that can return a MIN_VALUE and raise an issue when used together with Math.abs are: Random.nextInt() and Random.nextLong() hashCode() compareTo() Alternatively, the absExact() method throws an ArithmeticException for MIN_VALUE.
