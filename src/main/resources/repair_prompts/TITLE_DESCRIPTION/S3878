Arrays should not be created for varargs parameters
Why is this an issue? Thereâ€™s no point in creating an array solely for the purpose of passing it as a varargs (...) argument; varargs is an array. Simply pass the elements directly. They will be consolidated into an array automatically. Incidentally passing an array where Object ... is expected makes the intent ambiguous: Is the array supposed to be one object or a collection of objects?
