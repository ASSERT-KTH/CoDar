Unnecessary boxing and unboxing should be avoided
Why is this an issue? Boxing is the process of putting a primitive value into a wrapper object, such as creating an Integer to hold an int value. Unboxing is the process of retrieving the primitive value from such an object. Since the original value is unchanged during boxing and unboxing, there is no point in doing either when not needed. Instead, you should rely on Javaâ€™s implicit boxing/unboxing to convert from the primitive type to the wrapper type and vice versa, for better readability.
