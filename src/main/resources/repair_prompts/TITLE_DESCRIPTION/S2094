Classes should not be empty
Why is this an issue? There is no good excuse for an empty class. If itâ€™s being used simply as a common extension point, it should be replaced with an interface. If it was stubbed in as a placeholder for future development it should be fleshed-out. In any other case, it should be eliminated.
