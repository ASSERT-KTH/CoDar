Creating cookies without the "secure" flag is security-sensitive
When a cookie is protected with the secure attribute set to true it will not be send by the browser over an unencrypted HTTP request and thus cannot be observed by an unauthorized person during a man-in-the-middle attack. Ask Yourself Whether the cookie is for instance a session-cookie not designed to be sent over non-HTTPS communication. itâ€™s not sure that the website contains mixed content or not (ie HTTPS everywhere or not) There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions. Recommended Secure Coding Practices It is recommended to use HTTPs everywhere so setting the secure flag to true should be the default behaviour when creating cookies. Set the secure flag to true for session-cookies.
