Silly String operations should not be made
Creating a substring from 0 to the end is silly. You’ll end up with the same string you started with. Using the value of String.length as either the start or end of a substring has similarly predictable results. Calling String.contains with the argument being identical to the String on which contains is invoked doesn’t make sense.
