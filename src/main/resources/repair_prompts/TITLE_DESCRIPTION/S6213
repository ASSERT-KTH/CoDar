Restricted Identifiers should not be used as Identifiers
Why is this an issue? Even if it is technically possible, Restricted Identifiers should not be used as identifiers. This is only possible for compatibility reasons, using it in Java code is confusing and should be avoided. Note that this applies to any version of Java, including the one where these identifiers are not yet restricted, to avoid future confusion. This rule reports an issue when restricted identifiers: var yield record are used as identifiers.
