"Double.longBitsToDouble" should take "long" as argument
Why is this an issue? Double.longBitsToDouble converts the bit pattern into its corresponding floating-point representation. The method expects a 64-bit long argument to interpret the bits as a double value correctly. When the argument is a smaller data type, the cast to long may lead to a different value than expected due to the interpretation of the most significant bit, which, in turn, results in Double.longBitsToDouble returning an incorrect value.
