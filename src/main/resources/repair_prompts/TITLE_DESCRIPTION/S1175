The signature of "finalize()" should match that of "Object.finalize()"
Object.finalize() is called by the Garbage Collector at some point after the object becomes unreferenced. In general, overloading Object.finalize() is a bad idea because: The overload may not be called by the Garbage Collector. Users are not expected to call Object.finalize() and will get confused. But beyond that it’s a terrible idea to name a method "finalize" if it doesn’t actually override Object.finalize().
