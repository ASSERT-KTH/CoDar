Unicode Grapheme Clusters should be avoided inside regex character classes
Why is this an issue? When placing Unicode Grapheme Clusters (characters which require to be encoded in multiple Code Points) inside a character class of a regular expression, this will likely lead to unintended behavior. For instance, the grapheme cluster c̈ requires two code points: one for 'c', followed by one for the umlaut modifier '\u{0308}'. If placed within a character class, such as [c̈], the regex will consider the character class being the enumeration [c\u{0308}] instead. It will, therefore, match every 'c' and every umlaut that isn’t expressed as a single codepoint, which is extremely unlikely to be the intended behavior. This rule raises an issue every time Unicode Grapheme Clusters are used within a character class of a regular expression.
