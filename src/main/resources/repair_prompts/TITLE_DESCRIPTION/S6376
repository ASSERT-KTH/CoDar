XML parsers should not be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks
Why is this an issue? An XML bomb / billion laughs attack is a malicious XML document containing the same large entity repeated over and over again. If no restrictions is in place, such a limit on the number of entity expansions, the XML processor can consume a lot memory and time during the parsing of such documents leading to Denial of Service.
