Intermediate Stream methods should not be left unused
Why is this an issue? There are two types of stream operations: intermediate operations, which return another stream, and terminal operations, which return something other than a stream. Intermediate operations are lazy, meaning they arenâ€™t actually executed until and unless a terminal stream operation is performed on their results. Consequently, if the result of an intermediate stream operation is not fed to a terminal operation, it serves no purpose, which is almost certainly an error.
