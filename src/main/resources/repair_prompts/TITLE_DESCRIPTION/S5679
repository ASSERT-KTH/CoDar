OpenSAML2 should be configured to prevent authentication bypass
Why is this an issue? In 2018, Duo Security found a new vulnerability class that affects SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) systems and this led to the following vulnerabilities being disclosed: CVE-2017-11427, CVE-2017-11428, CVE-2017-11429, CVE-2017-11430, CVE-2018-0489, CVE-2018-7340. From a specially crafted <SAMLResponse> file, an attacker having already access to the SAML system with his own account can bypass the authentication mechanism and be authenticated as another user. This is due to the fact that SAML protocol rely on XML format and how the underlying XML parser interprets XML comments. If an attacker manage to change the <NameID> field identifying the authenticated user with XML comments, he can exploit the vulnerability. Here is an example of a potential payload: <SAMLResponse>
  [...]
  <Subject>
    <NameID>admin@domain.com<!---->.evil.com</NameID>
  </Subject>
  [...]
</SAMLResponse>
 The attacker will manage to generate a valid <SAMLResponse> content with the account "admin@domain.com.evil.com". He will modify it with XML comments to finally be authenticated as "admin@domain.com". To prevent this vulnerability on application using Spring Security SAML relying on OpenSAML2, XML comments should be ignored thanks to the property ignoreComments set to true.
