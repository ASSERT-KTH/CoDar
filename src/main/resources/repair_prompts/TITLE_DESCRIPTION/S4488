Composed "@RequestMapping" variants should be preferred
Why is this an issue? Spring framework 4.3 introduced variants of the @RequestMapping annotation to better represent the semantics of the annotated methods. The use of @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @PatchMapping and @DeleteMapping should be preferred to the use of the raw @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.XYZ).
