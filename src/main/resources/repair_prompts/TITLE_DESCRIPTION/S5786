JUnit5 test classes and methods should have default package visibility
Why is this an issue? JUnit5 is more tolerant regarding the visibilities of Test classes than JUnit4, which required everything to be public. In this context, JUnit5 test classes can have any visibility but private, however, it is recommended to use the default package visibility, which improves readability of code.
