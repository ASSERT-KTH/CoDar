AWS region should not be set with a hardcoded String
Why is this an issue? When explicitly setting the region on an AWS Client, you should always prefer providing the value from the Enum Regions instead of a hardcoded String. This will allow you to transparently support any change in the API and avoid mistakes. This rule reports an issue when a hardcoded string is used instead of an available enum value.
