Using long-term access keys is security-sensitive
In AWS, long-term access keys will be valid until you manually revoke them. This makes them highly sensitive as any exposure can have serious consequences and should be used with care. This rule will trigger when encountering an instantiation of com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials. Ask Yourself Whether The access key is used directly in an application or AWS CLI script running on an Amazon EC2 instance. Cross-account access is needed. The access keys need to be embedded within a mobile application. Existing identity providers (SAML 2.0, on-premises identity store) already exists. For more information, see Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys. There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions. Recommended Secure Coding Practices Consider using IAM roles or other features of the AWS Security Token Service that provide temporary credentials, limiting the risks.
