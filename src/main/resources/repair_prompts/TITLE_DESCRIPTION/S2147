Catches should be combined
Why is this an issue? Since Java 7 it has been possible to catch multiple exceptions at once. Therefore, when multiple catch blocks have the same code, they should be combined for better readability. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the projectâ€™s sonar.java.source is lower than 7.
