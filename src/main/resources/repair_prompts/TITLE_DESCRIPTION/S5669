Vararg method arguments should not be confusing
Why is this an issue? Passing single null or primitive array argument to the variable arity method may not work as expected. In the case of null, it is not passed as array with single element, but the argument itself is null. In the case of a primitive array, if the formal parameter is Object..., it is passed as a single element array. This may not be obvious to someone not familiar with such corner cases, and it is probably better to avoid such ambiguities by explicitly casting the argument to the desired type.
