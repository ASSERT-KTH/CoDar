A new session should be created during user authentication
Why is this an issue? Session fixation attacks occur when an attacker can force a legitimate user to use a session ID that he knows. To avoid fixation attacks, itâ€™s a good practice to generate a new session each time a user authenticates and delete/invalidate the existing session (the one possibly known by the attacker).
