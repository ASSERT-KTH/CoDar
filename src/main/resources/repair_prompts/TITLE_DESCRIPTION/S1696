"NullPointerException" should not be caught
Why is this an issue? NullPointerException should be avoided, not caught. Any situation in which NullPointerException is explicitly caught can easily be converted to a null test, and any behavior being carried out in the catch block can easily be moved to the "is null" branch of the conditional.
