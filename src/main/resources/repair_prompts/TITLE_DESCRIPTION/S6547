Environment variables should not be defined from untrusted input
Why is this an issue? Environment variable tampering occurs in a web application when it retrieves data like parameters or headers from an incoming HTTP request and uses it to define the variables. Depending on the controlled variable, an attacker could man-in-the-middle network requests or, in rare cases, achieve code execution. What is the potential impact? An attacker defines sensitive environment variables and can reach non-intended features or influence application execution flow. These environment variables could be system defined or application-specific. Examples of CVEs that resulted from this vulnerability were CVE-2017-17562 and CVE-2022-43781. Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability. LD_PRELOAD: Hijacking library functions An attacker can upload a shared object to the web server and defines the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to ensure the shared object is loaded when an arbitrary executable is run. In this malicious shared object, the attacker would overwrite a used function in the arbitrary executable and achieve code execution. HTTP_PROXY: Man-in-the-middle newtork requests The web application runs an executable that respects the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. An attacker manipulates it to point to a reverse proxy controlled by him and thus can sniff any sensitive data shared in web requests. How to fix it in Java SE Code examples The following code is vulnerable to environment variable manipulation as it constructs the variables from untrusted data.
