"DateUtils.truncate" from Apache Commons Lang library should not be used
Why is this an issue? The ZonedDateTime is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone, introduced in Java 8. This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds, and a time zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date times. Date truncation to a specific time unit means setting the values up to the specific time unit to zero while keeping the values of the larger time units unchanged. The ZonedDateTime class provides a truncatedTo method that allows truncating the date in a significantly faster way than the DateUtils class from Commons Lang. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the project’s sonar.java.source is lower than 8.
