"@Controller" classes that use "@SessionAttributes" must call "setComplete" on their "SessionStatus" objects
Why is this an issue? A Spring @Controller that uses @SessionAttributes is designed to handle a stateful / multi-post form. Such @Controllers use the specified @SessionAttributes to store data on the server between requests. That data should be cleaned up when the session is over, but unless setComplete() is called on the SessionStatus object from a @RequestMapping method, neither Spring nor the JVM will know itâ€™s time to do that. Note that the SessionStatus object must be passed to that method as a parameter.
