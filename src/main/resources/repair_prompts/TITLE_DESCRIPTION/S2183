Ints and longs should not be shifted by zero or more than their number of bits-1
Why is this an issue? Since an int is a 32-bit variable, shifting by more than +/-31 is confusing at best and an error at worst. When the runtime shifts 32-bit integers, it uses the lowest 5 bits of the shift count operand. In other words, shifting an int by 32 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 33 is the same as shifting it by 1. Similarly, when shifting 64-bit integers, the runtime uses the lowest 6 bits of the shift count operand and shifting long by 64 is the same as shifting it by 0, and shifting it by 65 is the same as shifting it by 1.
