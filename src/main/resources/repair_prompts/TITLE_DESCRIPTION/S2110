Invalid "Date" values should not be used
Why is this an issue? Whether the valid value ranges for Date fields start with 0 or 1 varies by field. For instance, month starts at 0, and day of month starts at 1. Enter a date value that goes past the end of the valid range, and the date will roll without error or exception. For instance, enter 12 for month, and you’ll get January of the following year. This rule checks for bad values used in conjunction with java.util.Date, java.sql.Date, and java.util.Calendar. Specifically, values outside of the valid ranges: Field Valid month 0-11 date (day) 0-31 hour 0-23 minute 0-60 second 0-61 Note that this rule does not check for invalid leap years, leap seconds (second = 61), or invalid uses of the 31st day of the month.
