Assertions should be complete
Why is this an issue? It is very easy to write incomplete assertions when using some test frameworks. This rule enforces complete assertions in the following cases: Fest: assertThat is not followed by an assertion invocation AssertJ: assertThat is not followed by an assertion invocation Mockito: verify is not followed by a method invocation Truth: assertXXX is not followed by an assertion invocation In such cases, what is intended to be a test doesnâ€™t actually verify anything
