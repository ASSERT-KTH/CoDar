Spring components should use constructor injection
Why is this an issue? Spring @Controller, @Service, and @Repository classes are singletons by default, meaning only one instance of the class is ever instantiated in the application. Typically such a class might have a few static members, such as a logger, but all non-static members should be managed by Spring and supplied via constructor injection rather than by field injection. This rule raise an issue when any non-static member of a Spring component has an injection annotation.
