Exceptions should be either logged or rethrown but not both
Why is this an issue? In applications where the accepted practice is to log an Exception and then rethrow it, you end up with miles-long logs that contain multiple instances of the same exception. In multi-threaded applications debugging this type of log can be particularly hellish because messages from other threads will be interwoven with the repetitions of the logged-and-thrown Exception. Instead, exceptions should be either logged or rethrown, not both.
