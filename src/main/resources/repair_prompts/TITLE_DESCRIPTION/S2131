Primitives should not be boxed just for "String" conversion
This rule is deprecated; use S1158 instead. Why is this an issue? "Boxing" is the process of putting a primitive value into a primitive-wrapper object. When that’s done purely to use the wrapper class' toString method, it’s a waste of memory and cycles because those methods are static, and can therefore be used without a class instance. Similarly, using the static method valueOf in the primitive-wrapper classes with a non-String argument should be avoided.
