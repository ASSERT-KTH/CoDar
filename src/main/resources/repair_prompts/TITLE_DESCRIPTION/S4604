"@EnableAutoConfiguration" should be fine-tuned
This rule is deprecated, and will eventually be removed. Why is this an issue? "@EnableAutoConfiguration" is a convenient feature to configure the Spring Application Context by attempting to guess the beans that you are likely to need. The drawback is that it may load and configure beans the application will never use and therefore consume more CPU and RAM than really required. @EnableAutoConfiguration should be configured to exclude all the beans not required by the application. Alternatively, use the @Import annotation instead of @EnableAutoConfiguration, to explicitly import the useful AutoConfiguration classes. This rule applies for @SpringBootApplication as well.
