Equals method should be overridden in records containing array fields
Why is this an issue? In records, the default behavior of the equals() method is to check the equality by field values. This works well for primitive fields or fields, whose type overrides equals(), but this behavior doesnâ€™t work as expected for array fields. By default, array fields are compared by their reference, and overriding equals() is highly appreciated to achieve the deep equality check. The same strategy applies to hashcode() and toString() methods. This rule reports an issue if a record class has an array field and is not overriding equals(), hashcode() or toString() methods.
