Text blocks should not be used in complex expressions
Why is this an issue? In Java 15 Text Blocks are official and can be used just like an ordinary String. However, when they are used to represent a big chunk of text, they should not be used directly in complex expressions, as it decreases the readability. In this case, it is better to extract the text block into a variable or a field. This rule reports an issue when a text block longer than a number of lines given as a parameter is directly used within a lambda expression.
