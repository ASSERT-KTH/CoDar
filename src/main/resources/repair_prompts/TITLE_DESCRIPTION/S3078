"volatile" variables should not be used with compound operators
Why is this an issue? Using compound operators as well as increments and decrements (and toggling, in the case of booleans) on primitive fields are not atomic operations. That is, they donâ€™t happen in a single step. For instance, when a volatile primitive field is incremented or decremented you run the risk of data loss if threads interleave in the steps of the update. Instead, use a guaranteed-atomic class such as AtomicInteger, or synchronize the access.
