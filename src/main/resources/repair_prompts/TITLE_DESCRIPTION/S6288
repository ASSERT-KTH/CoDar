Authorizing non-authenticated users to use keys in the Android KeyStore is security-sensitive
Android KeyStore is a secure container for storing key materials, in particular it prevents key materials extraction, i.e. when the application process is compromised, the attacker cannot extract keys but may still be able to use them. It’s possible to enable an Android security feature, user authentication, to restrict usage of keys to only authenticated users. The lock screen has to be unlocked with defined credentials (pattern/PIN/password, biometric). Ask Yourself Whether The application requires prohibiting the use of keys in case of compromise of the application process. The key material is used in the context of a highly sensitive application like a e-banking mobile app. There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions. Recommended Secure Coding Practices It’s recommended to enable user authentication (by setting setUserAuthenticationRequired to true during key generation) to use keys for a limited duration of time (by setting appropriate values to setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds), after which the user must re-authenticate.
