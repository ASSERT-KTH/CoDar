Use Java 12 "switch" expression
Why is this an issue? Many existing switch statements are essentially simulations of switch expressions, where each arm either assigns to a common target variable or returns a value. Expressing this as a statement is roundabout, repetitive, and error-prone. Java 12 added support for switch expressions, which provide more succinct and less error-prone version of switch.
