Annotated Mockito objects should be initialized
Why is this an issue? Objects annotated with Mockito annotations @Mock, @Spy, @Captor, or @InjectMocks need to be initialized explicitly. There are several ways to do this: Call MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this) or MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) in a setup method Annotate test class with @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) (JUnit 4) Annotate test class with @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) (JUnit 5 Jupiter) Use @Rule public MockitoRule rule = MockitoJUnit.rule(); Test using uninitialized mocks will fail. Note that this only applies to annotated Mockito objects. It is not necessary to initialize objects instantiated via Mockito.mock() or Mockito.spy(). This rule raises an issue when a test class uses uninitialized mocks.
