Redundant constructors/methods should be avoided in records
Why is this an issue? In Java 16 records represent a brief notation for immutable data structures. Records have autogenerated implementations for constructors with all parameters, getters, equals, hashcode and toString. Although these methods can still be overridden inside records, there is no use to do so if no special logic is required. This rule reports an issue on empty compact constructors, trivial canonical constructors and simple getter methods with no additional logic.
