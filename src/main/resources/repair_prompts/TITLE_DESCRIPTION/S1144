Unused "private" methods should be removed
private methods that are never executed are dead code: unnecessary, inoperative code that should be removed. Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced. Note that this rule does not take reflection into account, which means that issues will be raised on private methods that are only accessed using the reflection API.
