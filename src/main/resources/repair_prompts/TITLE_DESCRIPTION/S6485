Hash-based collections with known capacity should be initialized with the proper related static method.
Hash-based collections with known capacity should be initialized with the proper related static method. Why is this an issue? When creating an instance of HashMap or HashSet, the developer can pick a constructor with known capacity. However, the requested capacity is not fully allocated by default. Indeed, when the collection reaches the load factor of the collection (default: 0.75), the collection is resized on the fly, leading to unexpected performance issues. How to fix it As of Java 19, hash-based collections provide a static method that allocates the requested capacity at construction time. Code examples
