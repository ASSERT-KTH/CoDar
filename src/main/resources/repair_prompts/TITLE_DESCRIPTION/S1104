Class variable fields should not have public accessibility
Why is this an issue? Public class variable fields do not respect the encapsulation principle and has three main disadvantages: Additional behavior such as validation cannot be added. The internal representation is exposed, and cannot be changed afterwards. Member values are subject to change from anywhere in the code and may not meet the programmerâ€™s assumptions. By using private attributes and accessor methods (set and get), unauthorized modifications are prevented.
