Allowing both safe and unsafe HTTP methods is security-sensitive
An HTTP method is safe when used to perform a read-only operation, such as retrieving information. In contrast, an unsafe HTTP method is used to change the state of an application, for instance to update a userâ€™s profile on a web application. Common safe HTTP methods are GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS. Common unsafe HTTP methods are POST, PUT and DELETE. Allowing both safe and unsafe HTTP methods to perform a specific operation on a web application could impact its security, for example CSRF protections are most of the time only protecting operations performed by unsafe HTTP methods. Ask Yourself Whether HTTP methods are not defined at all for a route/controller of the application. Safe HTTP methods are defined and used for a route/controller that can change the state of an application. There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions. Recommended Secure Coding Practices For all the routes/controllers of an application, the authorized HTTP methods should be explicitly defined and safe HTTP methods should only be used to perform read-only operations.
