"Map.get" and value test should be replaced with single method call
Why is this an issue? It’s a common pattern to test the result of a java.util.Map.get() against null or calling java.util.Map.containsKey() before proceeding with adding or changing the value in the map. However the java.util.Map API offers a significantly better alternative in the form of the computeIfPresent() and computeIfAbsent() methods. Using these instead leads to cleaner and more readable code. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the project’s sonar.java.source is not 8.
