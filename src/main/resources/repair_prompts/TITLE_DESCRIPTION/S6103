AssertJ assertions with "Consumer" arguments should contain assertion inside consumers
AssertJ assertions taking Consumer objects as arguments are expected to contain "requirements", which should themselves be expressed as assertions. This concerns the following methods: allSatisfy, anySatisfy, hasOnlyOneElementSatisfying, isInstanceOfSatisfying, noneSatisfy, satisfies, satisfiesAnyOf, zipSatisfy. These methods are assuming the Consumer will do the assertions itself. If you do not do any assertion in the Consumer, it probably means that you are inadvertently only partially testing your object. This rule raises an issue when a Consumer argument of any of the above methods does not contain any assertion.
