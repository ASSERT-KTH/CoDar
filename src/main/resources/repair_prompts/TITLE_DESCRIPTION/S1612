Lambdas should be replaced with method references
Why is this an issue? Method or constructor references are more readable than lambda expressions in many situations, and may therefore be preferred. However, method references are sometimes less concise than lambdas. In such cases, it might be preferrable to keep the lambda expression for better readability. Therefore, this rule only raises issues on lambda expressions where the replacement method reference is shorter. This rule is automatically disabled when the projectâ€™s sonar.java.source is lower than 8, as lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8. How to fix it Refer to the called method by its reference instead of wrapping it in a lambda expression. For instance: null checks can be replaced with references to Objects::isNull and Objects::nonNull Casts can be replaced with SomeClass.class::cast instanceof can be replaced with SomeClass.class::isInstance Code examples
