An abstract class should have both abstract and concrete methods
Why is this an issue? The purpose of an abstract class is to provide some heritable behaviors while also defining methods which must be implemented by sub-classes. A class with no abstract methods that was made abstract purely to prevent instantiation should be converted to a concrete class (i.e. remove the abstract keyword) with a private constructor. A class with only abstract methods and no inheritable behavior should be converted to an interface.
