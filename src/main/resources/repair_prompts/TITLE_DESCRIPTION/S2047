The names of methods with boolean return values should start with "is" or "has"
Why is this an issue? Well-named functions can allow the users of your code to understand at a glance what to expect from the function - even before reading the documentation. Toward that end, methods returning a boolean should have names that start with "is" or "has" rather than with "get".
