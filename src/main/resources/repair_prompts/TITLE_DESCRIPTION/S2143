"java.time" classes should be used for dates and times
Why is this an issue? The old, much-derided Date and Calendar classes have always been confusing and difficult to use properly, particularly in a multi-threaded context. JodaTime has long been a popular alternative, but now an even better option is built-in. Java 8’s JSR 310 implementation offers specific classes for: Class Use for LocalDate a date, without time of day, offset, or zone LocalTime the time of day, without date, offset, or zone LocalDateTime the date and time, without offset, or zone OffsetDate a date with an offset such as +02:00, without time of day, or zone OffsetTime the time of day with an offset such as +02:00, without date, or zone OffsetDateTime the date and time with an offset such as +02:00, without a zone ZonedDateTime the date and time with a time zone and offset YearMonth a year and month MonthDay month and day Year/MonthOfDay/DayOfWeek/… classes for the important fields DateTimeFields stores a map of field-value pairs which may be invalid Calendrical access to the low-level API Period a descriptive amount of time, such as "2 months and 3 days"
