Non-public methods should not be "@Transactional"
Why is this an issue? Marking a non-public method @Transactional is both useless and misleading because Spring does not recognize non-public methods, and so makes no provision for their proper invocation. Nor does Spring make provision for the methods invoked by the method it called. Therefore marking a private method, for instance, @Transactional can only result in a runtime error or exception if the method is annotated as @Transactional. How to fix it Make the method public or remove the @Transactional annotation. Code examples
