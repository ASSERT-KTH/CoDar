Empty statements should be removed
Empty statements, i.e. ;, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because: It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten. There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. ;;. 
### Noncompliant
void doSomething() {
  ;                                                       // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");;                     // Noncompliant - double ;
  ...
}
 
### Compliant
void doSomething() {}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  ...
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) ; // compliant if unique statement of a loop
  ...
}
 See CERT, MSC12-C. - Detect and remove code that has no effect or is never executed CERT, MSC51-J. - Do not place a semicolon immediately following an if, for, or while condition CERT, EXP15-C. - Do not place a semicolon on the same line as an if, for, or while statement
