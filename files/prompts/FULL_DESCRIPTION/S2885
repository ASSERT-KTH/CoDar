Non-thread-safe fields should not be static
Not all classes in the standard Java library were written to be thread-safe. Using them in a multi-threaded manner is highly likely to cause data problems or exceptions at runtime. This rule raises an issue when an instance of Calendar, DateFormat, javax.xml.xpath.XPath, or javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory is marked static. 
### Noncompliant
public class MyClass {
  private static SimpleDateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat("HH-mm-ss");  // Noncompliant
  private static Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();  // Noncompliant
 
### Compliant
public class MyClass {
  private SimpleDateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat("HH-mm-ss");
  private Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
### Noncompliant
