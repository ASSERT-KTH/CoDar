"=+" should not be used instead of "+="
The use of operators pairs ( =+, =- or =! ) where the reversed, single operator was meant (+=, -= or !=) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results. This rule raises an issue when =+, =-, or =! is used without any spacing between the two operators and when there is at least one whitespace character after. 
### Noncompliant
int target = -5;
int num = 3;

target =- num;  // Noncompliant; target = -3. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num; // Noncompliant; target = 3
 
### Compliant
int target = -5;
int num = 3;

target = -num;  // Compliant; intent to assign inverse value of num is clear
target += num;
