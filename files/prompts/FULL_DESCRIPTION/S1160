Public methods should throw at most one checked exception
Using checked exceptions forces method callers to deal with errors, either by propagating them or by handling them. Throwing exceptions makes them fully part of the API of the method. But to keep the complexity for callers reasonable, methods should not throw more than one kind of checked exception.
