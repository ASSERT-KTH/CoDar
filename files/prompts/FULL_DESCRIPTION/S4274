Asserts should not be used to check the parameters of a public method
An assert is inappropriate for parameter validation because assertions can be disabled at runtime in the JVM, meaning that a bad operational setting would completely eliminate the intended checks. Further, asserts that fail throw AssertionErrors, rather than throwing some type of Exception. Throwing Errors is completely outside of the normal realm of expected catch/throw behavior in normal programs. This rule raises an issue when a public method uses one or more of its parameters with asserts. 
### Noncompliant
 public void setPrice(int price) {
  assert price >= 0 && price <= MAX_PRICE;
  // Set the price
 }
 
### Compliant
 public void setPrice(int price) {
  if (price < 0 || price > MAX_PRICE) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid price: " + price);
  }
  // Set the price
 }
