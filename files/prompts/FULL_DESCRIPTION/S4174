Local constants should follow naming conventions for constants
Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. This rule checks that all local, final, initialized, primitive variables, have names that match a provided regular expression. 
### Noncompliant
With the default regular expression ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*(_[A-Z0-9]+)*$: public void doSomething() {
  final int local = 42;
  ...
}
 
### Compliant
public void doSomething() {
  final int LOCAL = 42;
  ...
}
### Noncompliant
