Methods should not be named "tostring", "hashcode" or "equal"
Naming a method tostring, hashcode or equal is either: A bug in the form of a typo. Overriding toString, Object.hashCode() (note the camelCasing) or Object.equals (note the 's' on the end) was meant, and the application does not behave as expected. Done on purpose. The name however will confuse every other developer, who may not notice the naming difference, or who will think it is a bug. In both cases, the method should be renamed. 
### Noncompliant
public int hashcode() { /* ... */ }  // Noncompliant

public String tostring() { /* ... */ } // Noncompliant

public boolean equal(Object obj) { /* ... */ }  // Noncompliant
 
### Compliant
@Override
public int hashCode() { /* ... */ }

@Override
public String toString() { /* ... */ }

@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) { /* ... */ }
