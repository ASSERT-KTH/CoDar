Static fields should not be updated in constructors
Assigning a value to a static field in a constructor could cause unreliable behavior at runtime since it will change the value for all instances of the class. Instead remove the fieldâ€™s static modifier, or initialize it statically. 
### Noncompliant
public class Person {
  static Date dateOfBirth;
  static int expectedFingers;

  public Person(date birthday) {
    dateOfBirth = birthday;  // Noncompliant; now everyone has this birthday
    expectedFingers = 10;  // Noncompliant
  }
}
 
### Compliant
public class Person {
  Date dateOfBirth;
  static int expectedFingers = 10;

  public Person(date birthday) {
    dateOfBirth = birthday;
  }
}
