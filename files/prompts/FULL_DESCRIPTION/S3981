Collection sizes and array length comparisons should make sense
The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size or length is greater than or equal to zero doesnâ€™t make sense, since the result is always true. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return false. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness of the collection or array instead. 
### Noncompliant
if (myList.size() >= 0) { ... }

if (myList.size() < 0) { ... }

boolean result = myArray.length >= 0;

if (0 > myArray.length) { ... }
 
### Compliant
if (!myList.isEmpty()) { ... }

if (myArray.length >= 42) { ... }
### Noncompliant
