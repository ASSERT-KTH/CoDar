"Arrays.stream" should be used for primitive arrays
For arrays of objects, Arrays.asList(T ... a).stream() and Arrays.stream(array) are basically equivalent in terms of performance. However, for arrays of primitives, using Arrays.asList will force the construction of a list of boxed types, and then use that list as a stream. On the other hand, Arrays.stream uses the appropriate primitive stream type (IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream) when applicable, with much better performance.
