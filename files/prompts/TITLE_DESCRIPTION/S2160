Subclasses that add fields should override "equals"
Extend a class that overrides equals and add fields without overriding equals in the subclass, and you run the risk of non-equivalent instances of your subclass being seen as equal, because only the superclass fields will be considered in the equality test. This rule looks for classes that do all of the following: extend classes that override equals. do not themselves override equals. add fields.
