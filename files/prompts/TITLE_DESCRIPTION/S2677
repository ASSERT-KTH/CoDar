"read" and "readLine" return values should be used
When a method is called that returns data read from some data source, that data should be stored rather than thrown away. Any other course of action is surely a bug. This rule raises an issue when the return value of any of the following is ignored or merely null-checked: BufferedReader.readLine(), Reader.read(), and these methods in any child classes.
