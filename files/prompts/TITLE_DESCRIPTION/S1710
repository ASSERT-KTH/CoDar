Annotation repetitions should not be wrapped
Before Java 8 if you needed to use multiple instances of the same annotation, they had to be wrapped in a container annotation. With Java 8, that’s no longer necessary, allowing for cleaner, more readable code. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the project’s sonar.java.source is lower than 8.
