Similar tests should be grouped in a single Parameterized test
When multiple tests differ only by a few hardcoded values they should be refactored as a single "parameterized" test. This reduces the chances of adding a bug and makes them more readable. Parameterized tests exist in most test frameworks (JUnit, TestNG, etcâ€¦). The right balance needs of course to be found. There is no point in factorizing test methods when the parameterized version is a lot more complex than initial tests. This rule raises an issue when at least 3 tests could be refactored as one parameterized test with less than 4 parameters. Only test methods which have at least one duplicated statement are considered.
