Loggers should be "private static final" and should share a naming convention
Regardless of the logging framework in use (logback, log4j, commons-logging, java.util.logging, â€¦), loggers should be: private: never be accessible outside of its parent class. If another class needs to log something, it should instantiate its own logger. static: not be dependent on an instance of a class (an object). When logging something, contextual information can of course be provided in the messages but the logger should be created at class level to prevent creating a logger along with each object. final: be created once and only once per class.
