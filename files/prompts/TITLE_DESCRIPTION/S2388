Inner class calls to super class methods should be unambiguous
When an inner class extends another class, and both its outer class and its parent class have a method with the same name, calls to that method can be confusing. The compiler will resolve the call to the superclass method, but maintainers may be confused, so the superclass method should be called explicitly, using super..
