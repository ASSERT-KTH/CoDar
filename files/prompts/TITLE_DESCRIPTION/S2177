Child class methods named for parent class methods should be overrides
When a method in a child class has the same signature as a method in a parent class, it is assumed to be an override. However, thatâ€™s not the case when: the parent class method is static and the child class method is not. the arguments or return types of the child method are in different packages than those of the parent method. the parent class method is private. Typically, these things are done unintentionally; the private parent class method is overlooked, the static keyword in the parent declaration is overlooked, or the wrong class is imported in the child. But if the intent is truly for the child class method to be different, then the method should be renamed to prevent confusion.
