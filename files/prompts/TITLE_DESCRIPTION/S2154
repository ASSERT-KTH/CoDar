Dissimilar primitive wrappers should not be used with the ternary operator without explicit casting
If wrapped primitive values (e.g. Integers and Floats) are used in a ternary operator (e.g. a?b:c), both values will be unboxed and coerced to a common type, potentially leading to unexpected results. To avoid this, add an explicit cast to a compatible type.
