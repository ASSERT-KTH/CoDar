Non-primitive fields should not be "volatile"
Marking an array volatile means that the array itself will always be read fresh and never thread cached, but the items in the array will not be. Similarly, marking a mutable object field volatile means the object reference is volatile but the object itself is not, and other threads may not see updates to the object state. This can be salvaged with arrays by using the relevant AtomicArray class, such as AtomicIntegerArray, instead. For mutable objects, the volatile should be removed, and some other method should be used to ensure thread-safety, such as synchronization, or ThreadLocal storage.
