Spring beans should be considered by "@ComponentScan"
Spring beans belonging to packages that are not included in a @ComponentScan configuration will not be accessible in the Spring Application Context. Therefore, itâ€™s likely to be a configuration mistake that will be detected by this rule. Note: the @ComponentScan is implicit in the @SpringBootApplication annotation, case in which Spring Boot will auto scan for components in the package containing the Spring Boot main class and its sub-packages.
