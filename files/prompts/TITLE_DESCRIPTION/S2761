Unary prefix operators should not be repeated
The needless repetition of an operator is usually a typo. There is no reason to write !!!i when !i will do. On the other hand, the repetition of increment and decrement operators may have been done on purpose, but doing so obfuscates the meaning, and should be simplified. This rule raises an issue for sequences of: !, ~, -, and +.
