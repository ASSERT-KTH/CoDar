"Collections.EMPTY_LIST", "EMPTY_MAP", and "EMPTY_SET" should not be used
Since the introduction of generics in Java 5, the use of generic types such as List<String> is recommended over the use of raw ones such as List. Assigning a raw type to a generic one is not type safe, and will generate a warning. The old EMPTY_... fields of the Collections class return raw types, whereas the newer empty...() methods return generic ones.
