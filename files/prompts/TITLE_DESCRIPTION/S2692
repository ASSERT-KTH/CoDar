"indexOf" checks should not be for positive numbers
Most checks against an indexOf value compare it with -1 because 0 is a valid index. Any checks which look for values >0 ignore the first element, which is likely a bug. If the intent is merely to check inclusion of a value in a String or a List, consider using the contains method instead. This rule raises an issue when an indexOf value retrieved either from a String or a List is tested against >0.
