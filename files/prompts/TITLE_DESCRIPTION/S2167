"compareTo" should not return "Integer.MIN_VALUE"
It is the sign, rather than the magnitude of the value returned from compareTo that matters. Returning Integer.MIN_VALUE does not convey a higher degree of inequality, and doing so can cause errors because the return value of compareTo is sometimes inversed, with the expectation that negative values become positive. However, inversing Integer.MIN_VALUE yields Integer.MIN_VALUE rather than Integer.MAX_VALUE.
