"java.nio.Files#delete" should be preferred
When java.io.File#delete fails, this boolean method simply returns false with no indication of the cause. On the other hand, when java.nio.file.Files#delete fails, this void method returns one of a series of exception types to better indicate the cause of the failure. And since more information is generally better in a debugging situation, java.nio.file.Files#delete is the preferred option.
