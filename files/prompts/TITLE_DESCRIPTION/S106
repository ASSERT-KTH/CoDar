Standard outputs should not be used directly to log anything
When logging a message there are several important requirements which must be fulfilled: The user must be able to easily retrieve the logs The format of all logged message must be uniform to allow the user to easily read the log Logged data must actually be recorded Sensitive data must only be logged securely If a program directly writes to the standard outputs, there is absolutely no way to comply with those requirements. Thatâ€™s why defining and using a dedicated logger is highly recommended.
