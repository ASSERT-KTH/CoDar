"Thread.run()" should not be called directly
The purpose of the Thread.run() method is to execute code in a separate, dedicated thread. Calling this method directly doesnâ€™t make sense because it causes its code to be executed in the current thread. To get the expected behavior, call the Thread.start() method instead.
