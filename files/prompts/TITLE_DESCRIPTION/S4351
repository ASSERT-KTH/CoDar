"compareTo" should not be overloaded
When implementing the Comparable<T>.compareTo method, the parameterâ€™s type has to match the type used in the Comparable declaration. When a different type is used this creates an overload instead of an override, which is unlikely to be the intent. This rule raises an issue when the parameter of the compareTo method of a class implementing Comparable<T> is not same as the one used in the Comparable declaration.
