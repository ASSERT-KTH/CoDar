Cipher algorithms should be robust
Strong cipher algorithms are cryptographic systems resistant to cryptanalysis, they are not vulnerable to well-known attacks like brute force attacks for example. A general recommendation is to only use cipher algorithms intensively tested and promoted by the cryptographic community. More specifically for block cipher, itâ€™s not recommended to use algorithm with a block size inferior than 128 bits.
