Collection sizes and array length comparisons should make sense
The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size or length is greater than or equal to zero doesn’t make sense, since the result is always true. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return false. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness of the collection or array instead.
