Derived exceptions should not hide their parents' catch blocks
The catch block of a checked exception "E" may be hidden because the corresponding try block only throws exceptions derived from E. These derived exceptions are handled in dedicated catch blocks prior to the catch block of the base exception E. The catch block of E is unreachable and should be considered dead code. It should be removed, or the entire try-catch structure should be refactored. It is also possible that a single exception type in a multi-catch block may be hidden while the catch block itself is still reachable. In that case it is enough to only remove the hidden exception type or to replace it with another type.
