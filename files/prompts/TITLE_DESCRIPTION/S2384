Mutable members should not be stored or returned directly
Mutable objects are those whose state can be changed. For instance, an array is mutable, but a String is not. Mutable class members should never be returned to a caller or accepted and stored directly. Doing so leaves you vulnerable to unexpected changes in your class state. Instead use an unmodifiable Collection (via Collections.unmodifiableCollection, Collections.unmodifiableList, â€¦) or make a copy of the mutable object, and store or return the copy instead. This rule checks that arrays, collections and Dates are not stored or returned directly.
