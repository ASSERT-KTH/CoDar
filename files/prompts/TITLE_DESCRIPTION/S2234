Parameters should be passed in the correct order
When the names of parameters in a method call match the names of the method arguments, it contributes to clearer, more readable code. However, when the names match, but are passed in a different order than the method arguments, it indicates a mistake in the parameter order which will likely lead to unexpected results.
