The non-serializable super class of a "Serializable" class should have a no-argument constructor
When a Serializable object has a non-serializable ancestor in its inheritance chain, object deserialization (re-instantiating the object from file) starts at the first non-serializable class, and proceeds down the chain, adding the properties of each subsequent child class, until the final object has been instantiated. In order to create the non-serializable ancestor, its no-argument constructor is called. Therefore the non-serializable ancestor of a Serializable class must have a no-arg constructor. Otherwise the class is Serializable but not deserializable.
