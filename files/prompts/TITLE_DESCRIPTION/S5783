Only one method invocation is expected when testing checked exceptions
When verifying that code raises an exception, a good practice is to avoid having multiple method calls inside the tested code, to be explicit about what is exactly tested. When two of the methods can raise the same checked exception, not respecting this good practice is a bug, since it is not possible to know what is really tested. You should make sure that only one method can raise the expected checked exception in the tested code.
