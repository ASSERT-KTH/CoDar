Cipher Block Chaining IVs should be unpredictable
When encrypting data with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode an Initialization Vector (IV) is used to randomize the encryption, ie under a given key the same plaintext doesn’t always produce the same ciphertext. The IV doesn’t need to be secret but should be unpredictable to avoid "Chosen-Plaintext Attack". To generate Initialization Vectors, NIST recommends to use a secure random number generator.
