Single-character alternations in regular expressions should be replaced with character classes
When an alternation contains multiple alternatives that consist of a single character, it can be rewritten as a character class. This should be preferred because it is more efficient and can even help prevent stack overflows when used inside a repetition (see rule {rule:java:S5998}).
