JUnit rules should be used
While some TestRule classes have the desired effect without ever being directly referenced by a test, several others do not, and there’s no reason to leave them cluttering up the file if they’re not in use. This rule raises an issue when Test class fields of the following types aren’t used by any of the test methods: TemporaryFolder, and TestName. This rule also applies to the JUnit 5 equivalent classes: TempDir, and TestInfo.
