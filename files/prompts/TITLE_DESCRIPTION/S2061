Custom serialization method signatures should meet requirements
Writers of Serializable classes can choose to let Javaâ€™s automatic mechanisms handle serialization and deserialization, or they can choose to handle it themselves by implementing specific methods. However, if the signatures of those methods are not exactly what is expected, they will be ignored and the default serialization mechanisms will kick back in.
