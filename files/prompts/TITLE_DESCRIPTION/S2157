"Cloneables" should implement "clone"
Simply implementing Cloneable without also overriding Object.clone() does not necessarily make the class cloneable. While the Cloneable interface does not include a clone method, it is required by convention, and ensures true cloneability. Otherwise the default JVM clone will be used, which copies primitive values and object references from the source to the target. I.e. without overriding clone, any cloned instances will potentially share members with the source instance. Removing the Cloneable implementation and providing a good copy constructor is another viable (some say preferable) way of allowing a class to be copied.
