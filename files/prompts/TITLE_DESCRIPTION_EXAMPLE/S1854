Unused assignments should be removed
A dead store happens when a local variable is assigned a value that is not read by any subsequent instruction. Calculating or retrieving a value only to then overwrite it or throw it away, could indicate a serious error in the code. Even if itâ€™s not an error, it is at best a waste of resources. Therefore all calculated values should be used. 
### Noncompliant
i = a + b; // Noncompliant; calculation result not used before value is overwritten
i = compute();
### Compliant
i = a + b;
i += compute();
