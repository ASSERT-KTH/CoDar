Parentheses should be removed from a single lambda input parameter when its type is inferred
There are two possible syntaxes for a lambda having only one input parameter with an inferred type: with and without parentheses around that single parameter. The simpler syntax, without parentheses, is more compact and readable than the one with parentheses, and is therefore preferred. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the projectâ€™s sonar.java.source is lower than 8.
