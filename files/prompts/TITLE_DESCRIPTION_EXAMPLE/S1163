Exceptions should not be thrown in finally blocks
Throwing an exception from within a finally block will mask any exception which was previously thrown in the try or catch block, and the maskedâ€™s exception message and stack trace will be lost. 
### Noncompliant
try {
  /* some work which end up throwing an exception */
  throw new IllegalArgumentException();
} finally {
  /* clean up */
  throw new RuntimeException();       // Noncompliant; masks the IllegalArgumentException
}
