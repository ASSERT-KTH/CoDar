"Thread.run()" should not be called directly
The purpose of the Thread.run() method is to execute code in a separate, dedicated thread. Calling this method directly doesnâ€™t make sense because it causes its code to be executed in the current thread. To get the expected behavior, call the Thread.start() method instead. 
### Noncompliant
Thread myThread = new Thread(runnable);
myThread.run(); // Noncompliant
 
### Compliant
Thread myThread = new Thread(runnable);
myThread.start(); // Compliant
 See MITRE, CWE-572 - Call to Thread run() instead of start() CERT THI00-J. - Do not invoke Thread.run()
