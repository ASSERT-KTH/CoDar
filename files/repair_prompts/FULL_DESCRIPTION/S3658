Unit tests should throw exceptions
When the code under test in a unit test throws an exception, the test itself fails. Therefore, there is no need to surround the tested code with a try-catch structure to detect failure. Instead, you can simply move the exception type to the method signature. This rule raises an issue when there is a fail assertion inside a catch block.

### Noncompliant
@Test
public void testMethod() {
  try {
            // Some code
  } catch (MyException e) {
    Assert.fail(e.getMessage());  // Noncompliant
  }
}
 
### Compliant
@Test
public void testMethod() throws MyException {
    // Some code
}
