Escape sequences should not be used in text blocks
The use of escape sequences is mostly unnecessary in text blocks. 
### Noncompliant
\n can be replaced by simply introducing the newline, \"\"\" it is sufficient to escape only the first qoute. String textBlock = """
        \"\"\" this \nis
        text  block!
        !!!!
      """;
 
### Compliant
String textBlock = """
        \""" this
        is
        text  block!
        !!!!
      """;
