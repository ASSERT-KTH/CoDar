Methods should not return constants
Thereâ€™s no point in forcing the overhead of a method call for a method that always returns the same constant value. Even worse, the fact that a method call must be made will likely mislead developers who call the method thinking that something more is done. Declare a constant instead. This rule raises an issue if on methods that contain only one statement: the return of a constant value.
