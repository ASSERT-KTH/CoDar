String literals should not be duplicated
Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring error-prone, since you must be sure to update all occurrences. On the other hand, constants can be referenced from many places, but only need to be updated in a single place. 
### Noncompliant
public void run() {
  prepare("action1");                              // Noncompliant - "action1" is duplicated 3 times
  execute("action1");
  release("action1");
}

@SuppressWarning("all")                            // Compliant - annotations are excluded
private void method1() { /* ... */ }
@SuppressWarning("all")
private void method2() { /* ... */ }

public String method3(String a) {
  System.out.println("'" + a + "'");               // Compliant - literal "'" has less than 5 characters and is excluded
  return "";                                       // Compliant - literal "" has less than 5 characters and is excluded
}
### Compliant
private static final String ACTION_1 = "action1";  

public void run() {
  prepare(ACTION_1);                               
  execute(ACTION_1);
  release(ACTION_1);
}
