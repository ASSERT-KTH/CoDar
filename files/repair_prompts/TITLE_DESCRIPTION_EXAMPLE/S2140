Methods of "Random" that return floating point values should not be used in random integer generation
There is no need to multiply the output of Random's nextDouble method to get a random integer. Use the nextInt method instead. This rule raises an issue when the return value of any of Random's methods that return a floating point value is converted to an integer. 
### Noncompliant
Random r = new Random();
int rand = (int)r.nextDouble() * 50;  // Noncompliant way to get a pseudo-random value between 0 and 50
int rand2 = (int)r.nextFloat(); // Noncompliant; will always be 0;
### Compliant
Random r = new Random();
int rand = r.nextInt(50);  // returns pseudo-random value between 0 and 50
### Noncompliant
