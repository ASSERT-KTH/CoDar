Regexes containing characters subject to normalization should use the CANON_EQ flag
Characters like 'eÃÅ' can be expressed either as a single code point or as a cluster of the letter 'e' and a combining accent mark. Without the CANON_EQ flag, a regex will only match a string in which the characters are expressed in the same way.
