"equals" method overrides should accept "Object" parameters
"equals" as a method name should be used exclusively to override Object.equals(Object) to prevent any confusion. It is tempting to overload the method to take a specific class instead of Object as parameter, to save the class comparison check. However, this will not work as expected when that is the only override.
