"ThreadLocal" variables should be cleaned up when no longer used
ThreadLocal variables are supposed to be garbage collected once the holding thread is no longer alive. Memory leaks can occur when holding threads are re-used which is the case on application servers using pool of threads. To avoid such problems, it is recommended to always clean up ThreadLocal variables using the remove() method to remove the current threadâ€™s value for the ThreadLocal variable. In addition, calling set(null) to remove the value might keep the reference to this pointer in the map, which can cause memory leak in some scenarios. Using remove is safer to avoid this issue.
