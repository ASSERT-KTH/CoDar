Switches should be used for sequences of simple "String" tests
Since Java 7, Strings can be used as switch arguments. So when a single String is tested against three or more values in an if/else if structure, it should be converted to a switch instead for greater readability. Note that this rule is automatically disabled when the projectâ€™s sonar.java.source is lower than 7.
