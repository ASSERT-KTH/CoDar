"read(byte[],int,int)" should be overridden
When directly subclassing java.io.InputStream or java.io.FilterInputStream, the only requirement is that you implement the method read(). However most uses for such streams don’t read a single byte at a time and the default implementation for read(byte[],int,int) will call read(int) for every single byte in the array which can create a lot of overhead and is utterly inefficient. It is therefore strongly recommended that subclasses provide an efficient implementation of read(byte[],int,int). This rule raises an issue when a direct subclass of java.io.InputStream or java.io.FilterInputStream doesn’t provide an override of read(byte[],int,int).
