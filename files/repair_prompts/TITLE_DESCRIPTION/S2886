Getters and setters should be synchronized in pairs
When one part of a getter/setter pair is synchronized the other part should be too. Failure to synchronize both sides of a pair may result in inconsistent behavior at runtime as callers access an inconsistent method state. This rule raises an issue when either the method or the contents of one method in a getter/setter pair are synchrnoized but the other is not.
