Jump statements should not occur in "finally" blocks
Using return, break, throw, and so on from a finally block suppresses the propagation of any unhandled Throwable which was thrown in the try or catch block. This rule raises an issue when a jump statement (break, continue, return, throw, and goto) would force control flow to leave a finally block.
