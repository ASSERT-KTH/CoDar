Test assertions should include messages
Adding messages to JUnit, FEST and AssertJ assertions is an investment in your future productivity. Spend a few seconds writing them now, and youâ€™ll save a lot of time on the other end when either the tests fail and you need to quickly diagnose the problem, or when you need to maintain the tests and the assertion messages work as a sort of documentation.
