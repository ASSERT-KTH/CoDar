Standard functional interfaces should not be redefined
Just as there is little justification for writing your own String class, there is no good reason to re-define one of the existing, standard functional interfaces. Doing so may seem tempting, since it would allow you to specify a little extra context with the name. But in the long run, it will be a source of confusion, because maintenance programmers will wonder what is different between the custom functional interface and the standard one.
