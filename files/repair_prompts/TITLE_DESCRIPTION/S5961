Test methods should not contain too many assertions
A common good practice is to write test methods targeting only one logical concept, that can only fail for one reason. While it might make sense to have more than one assertion to test one concept, having too many is a sign that a test became too complex and should be refactored to multiples ones. This rule will report any test method containing more than a given number of assertion.
