Printf-style format strings should not lead to unexpected behavior at runtime
Because printf-style format strings are interpreted at runtime, rather than validated by the Java compiler, they can contain errors that lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors. This rule statically validates the good behavior of printf-style formats when calling the format(...) methods of java.util.Formatter, java.lang.String, java.io.PrintStream, MessageFormat, and java.io.PrintWriter classes and the printf(...) methods of java.io.PrintStream or java.io.PrintWriter classes.
