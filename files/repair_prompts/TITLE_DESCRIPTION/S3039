"String" calls should not go beyond their bounds
Just as you can’t cut something into three halves, you can’t grab a substring that starts or ends outside the original String's bounds, you can’t use substring to get a reversed portion of a String, and you can’t get the charAt a value that’s before the String starts or after it ends. This rule detects when negative literal or String::length is passed as an argument to the String::substring, String::charAt and related methods.
