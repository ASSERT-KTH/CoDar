Factory method injection should be used in "@Configuration" classes
When @Autowired is used, dependencies need to be resolved when the class is instantiated, which may cause early initialization of beans or lead the context to look in places it shouldnâ€™t to find the bean. To avoid this tricky issue and optimize the way the context loads, dependencies should be requested as late as possible. That means using parameter injection instead of field injection for dependencies that are only used in a single @Bean method.
