Exception classes should be immutable
Exceptions are meant to represent the application’s state at the point at which an error occurred. Making all fields in an Exception class final ensures that this state: Will be fully defined at the same time the Exception is instantiated. Won’t be updated or corrupted by a questionable error handler. This will enable developers to quickly understand what went wrong.
