Cryptographic keys should be robust
Most of cryptographic systems require a sufficient key size to be robust against brute-force attacks. NIST recommendations will be checked for these use-cases: Digital Signature Generation and Verification: p ≥ 2048 AND q ≥ 224 for DSA (p is key length and q the modulus length) n ≥ 2048 for RSA (n is the key length) Key Agreement: p ≥ 2048 AND q ≥ 224 for DH and MQV n ≥ 224 for ECDH and ECMQV (Examples: secp192r1 is a non-compliant curve (n < 224) but secp224k1 is compliant (n >= 224)) Symmetric keys: key length ≥ 128 bits This rule will not raise issues for ciphers that are considered weak (no matter the key size) like DES, Blowfish.
