AssertJ assertions "allMatch" and "doesNotContains" should also test for emptiness
AssertJ assertions allMatch and doesNotContains on an empty list always returns true whatever the content of the predicate. Despite being correct, you should make explicit if you expect an empty list or not, by adding isEmpty()/isNotEmpty() in addition to calling the assertion, or by testing the listâ€™s content further. It will justify the useless predicate to improve clarity or increase the reliability of the test. This rule raises an issue when any of the methods listed are used without asserting that the list is empty or not and without testing the content.
